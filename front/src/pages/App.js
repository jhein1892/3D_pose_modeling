 * This is gonig to be a single page app to start with, and will essentially be just an  
 * MVP to see if this idea works.
 * 
 * I will use multiple components:
 *    First is an initial video input (Will turn into a carosel for multiple videos to    
 *    choose from)
 *    Second will be an input video option (With option later to use Webcam)
 *    Thrid is a comparison score output generator
